On a journey to its reconstruction and rebirth from horrific events of the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi. Rwanda is a very beautiful country located in the heart of Africa in the East African region. Very rich culture and is an amazing destination for tourism and business. At Ikirenga ACP, it is a privilege and a duty that we proudly take over to serve our country and contribute to its socio-economic development and we have made it a mission to promote artistic initiatives aimed at improving socio-economic and cultural development while also promoting cross-cultural understanding cooperation among countries/Nations, people and communities. We strongly believe that art, culture, and tourism are very powerful tools for cultural exchange and socio-economic development.
